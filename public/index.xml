      <description>IntroductionFor this project, I wanted to explore the musical attributes of the most popular songs from the past 55 years, defined here as songs that were included on Billboard’s annual Top 100 lists. What makes these songs unique? What makes a ‘popular’ song popular? How have mainstream musical tastes evolved over the last half century?
To conduct this analysis, I am using two datasets that list unique musical characteristics of the most popular songs from 1950 to 2017.</description>

      <description>IntroductionFor this project, I will be using a dataset that compiles characteristics of individual web users who did or did not click on an ad. This dataset, ad, contains the binary response variable ‘clicked on ad,’ quantified as either a 0 (did not click) or a 1 (did click). The dataset additionally includes the following variables: daily time spent on the website (in minutes), daily internet usage (in minutes), age, area income ($), and gender.</description>
